`class="crystalrow" loads pictures of crystals left to right, 

`4 CRYSTALS EACH HAVE A HIDDEN RANDOM VALUE AT THE START OF EACH GAME. CLICKING ON A CRYSTAL WILL ADD POINTS INSIDE PANEL2
crystal1 generates random values between 1-12, when clicked. crystal1 also passes that value to panel2 each time it's clicked. 
crystal2 generates random values between 1-12, when clicked. crystal2 also passes that value to panel2 each time it's clicked. 
crystal3 generates random values between 1-12, when clicked. crystal3 also passes that value to panel2 each time it's clicked.

each to begin a new value once the loss++1 or win++1 is added.

`include a <div> with <p> in a row that displays "Your score is: " that stands alone over panel2. 

MATCH THE RANDOM NUMBER WHEN CRYSTAL PHOTOS ARE CLICKED.
`panel2 is passed the assigned random value of each clicked crystal, whether it's "crytals1" "crystal2" "crystal3" or "crystal4" .onkeyup. 

`panel2 is to stop taking passes from class="crystalrow" when it is => than the random number in panel1.

`panel2 is to stop taking passes after it stops being <= random number in panel1.

`panel2 ++1 to "w" (w) if it's == to random number in panel1, Equally, if panel2 number is == panel1, then ++1 to "Wins: (w)"

`panel2 ++1 to "l" (l) if it's generated number is > than random number in panel1. Equally, if panel2 number is > panel 1, then ++1 to "Losses: (l)"

`panel2 also starts over after ++1 passed "l" is made.

`panel3 in row3 posts "You win!" if "Wins: (w)" is increased by ++1
`panel3 in row3 posts "You lost!" if "Losses: (l)" is increased by ++1

`panel3 also adds to each "Win: (x)" by ++1 if the number of wins is increased. 
`panel3 also adds to each "Losses: (l)" by ++1 if the number of wins is increased.


WHEN CRYSTAL PHOTOS ARE CLICKED

 MATCH THE RANDOM NUMBER to each crystal, then, add and display number to panel2 
1. if number in panel2 > random number in panel1
  ++1 to looses, show "You lost!" if "Losses: (l)" in panel3
2. if number in panel2 = random number in panel1
  ++1 to wins , show "You win!" if "Wins: (w)" in panel3
 //

new notes when crystal photos are clicked panel2 is passed the assigned random value of each clicked crystal , using .on() method - this is the .on("click", function(){}); which we study in class
because .onkeyup is triggered when we release a key in keyboard
we only click the mouse in this game. Thu,s we use .on("click"....
